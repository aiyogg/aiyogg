I am a web enthusiast who primarily focuses on front-end development and also dabbles in full-stack work outside of my regular job. I have been playing DOTA2 for over ten years, although I havenâ€™t played recently.
I am also interested in playing the guitar and practicing calligraphy. I hope someone can assist me with these hobbies here.
